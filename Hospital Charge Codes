Hospital Charge Data Organized Via Python
Given the hospital charge data, which was retrieved from www.data.gov, summary statistics were created through Python for the last three columns. The mean, median, mode, and standard deviation were organized into columns for the average coverage charges, average total payments, and average Medicare payments. The code below was created to organize this information.

# Import section
import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib as mpl

# Read in the health data
govdata = pd.read_csv ('/users/khaji123/desktop/
Inpatient_Prospective_Payment_System__
IPPS__Provider_Summary_for_the_Top_100_
Diagnosis-Related_Groups__DRG__-_
FY2011 (1).csv')

# Assign each column to a new data column without the $
acc = govdata[' Average Covered Charges '].str.lstrip('$')
atp = govdata[' Average Total Payments '].str.lstrip('$')
amp = govdata['Average Medicare Payments'].str.lstrip('$')


# Change the data type from oject to float so that it is numeric
# Assign to another new variable so the new data type "sticks"
accnum = acc.astype(float)
atpnum = atp.astype(float)
ampnum = amp.astype(float)

#update govdata table

govdata.update (accnum)
govdata.update (atpnum)
govdata.update (ampnum)

#Mean, Mode, Std. Dev for last 3 columns
accmean = accnum.mean()
accmode = accnum.mode()
accstd = accnum.std()

atpmean = atpnum.mean()

atpmode = atpnum.mode()
atpstd = atpnum.std()

ampmean = ampnum.mean()
ampmode = ampnum.mode()
ampstd = ampnum.std()

#print
govdata

print "Mean of Average Covered Charges"
print accmean
print "Mode of Average Covered Charges"
print accmode
print "STD of Average Covered Charges"
print accstd

print "Mean of Average Total Payments"
print atpmean
print "Mode of Average Total Payments"
print atpmode
print "STD of Average Total Payments"
print atpstd

print "Mean of Average Medical Payments"
print ampmean
print "Mode of Average Medical Payments"
print ampmode
print "STD of Average Medical Payments"
print ampstd



Once the information was organized graph summary statistics were produced for each individual column. Below are the codes that were inputted through python and the graphs that were outputted with numerical representations. 
# prepare some data
data = {"y": [8494.49096403,3744.00, 7309.46726062]}

# output to static HTML file
output_file("bar.html")

# create a new line chat with a title and axis labels
p = Bar(data, cat=['Mean','Mode', 'STD'], title="Average Medical Payments",
        xlabel='categories', ylabel='values', width=400, height=400)

# show the results
show(p)


 


# prepare some data
data = {"y": [36133.9542244, 31155, 35065.3659313]}

# output to static HTML file
output_file("bar.html")

# create a new line chat with a title and axis labels
p = Bar(data, cat=['Mean','Mode', 'STD'], title="Average Coverage Charge",
        xlabel='categories', ylabel='values', width=400, height=400)

# show the results
show(p)


 
# prepare some data
data = {"y": [9707.47380419, 4370, 7664.64259815]}

# output to static HTML file
output_file("bar.html")

# create a new line chat with a title and axis labels
p = Bar(data, cat=['Mean','Mode', 'STD'], title="Average Total Payments",
        xlabel='categories', ylabel='values', width=400, height=400)

# show the results
show(p)

 




Then the data was organized by generating a geographic plot for the absolute cost of medical payments, by location. This task was difficult and I used http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery/choropleth.html and http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery/texas.html to help me create a code for my map. The python code below creates the results expected.
